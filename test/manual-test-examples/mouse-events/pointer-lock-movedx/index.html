    <h1>Manual test for movedX/Y with/without zoom and with/without pointer lock</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>If you move the mouse around, you should see 1 moving circle and 1 still. While <strong>dragging mouse</strong>, they should move at the same rate.</li>
      <li>After zooming in/out, on all browsers, the circles should still move visually a constant distance relative to each other.</li>
      <li>Press any key to request pointer lock. Background will be pink if and only if pointer is locked. Now, if you <strong>drag the mouse</strong>, the small circle should be static (because mouseX/Y are locked) and the big circle should move unsurprisingly.</li>
    </ul>
